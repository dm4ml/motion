In this guide, we'll create a Motion application that runs natural language queries on a group of datasets, learning from feedback and new data over time.

## Install Motion

Install Motion via pip:

```bash
pip install motion-python
```

## Write Components

Our application will consist of two components:

1. A component that keeps track of the datasets we have available and their metadata.
2. A component that uses an LLM to execute our natural language queries, learning prompts based on our feedback.

TODO

<!-- Then create a python file, `main.py`, with the following contents:

```python
from motion import Component

c = Component("")
``` -->
