In this guide, we'll create a simple Motion component that runs natural language queries on a group of datasets, learning from user feedback and new data over time.

Install Motion via pip:

```bash
pip install motion-python
```

Then create a python file, `main.py`, with the following contents:

```python
from motion import Component

c = Component(")
```
