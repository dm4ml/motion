# Motion Concepts

Building an ML application in Motion is a conceptual departure from standard methodology. In Motion, applications are developed in the same way as they are deployed.

At a high level, Motion applications are a combination of [_relations_](/concepts/relation) and [_triggers_](/concepts/trigger). Relations store data--both data ingested into applications and data generated by applications (e.g., ML model predictions). Triggers are stateful functions that are executed when a relation gets new data, and the output of a trigger is typically written back to a relation.

Every Motion application has a [project structure](/concepts/project) with a config file, which defines the application's relations, triggers, and other metadata. 

We explain all of this in more detail in the following sections.
