# Motion Concepts

Building an ML application in Motion is a conceptual departure from standard methodology. In Motion, applications are developed in the same way as they are deployed.

At a high level, Motion applications are a combination of _relations_ and _triggers_. Relations store data---both data ingested into applications and data generated by applications (e.g., ML model predictions). Triggers are stateful functions that are executed when a relation gets new data, and the output of a trigger is typically written back to a relation.

Every Motion application has a config file, which defines the application's relations, triggers, and other metadata.
