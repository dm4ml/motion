# Installing Motion

Motion is available on PyPI. Motion requires Python 3.8 or later. To install Motion, run the following command:

To verify motion is working as intended, run `motion` in your terminal. An usage explanation should be returned, as well as a list of CLI commands that can be executed.

## Installing from source

Motion is developed and maintained on Github. We use `poetry` to manage dependencies and build the package. To install Motion from source, run the following commands:
