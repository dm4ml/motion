# motion

A framework for building ML applications, using a trigger-based execution model.

## Getting Started

You must use Python 3.10 or later. We recommend using a virtual environment `conda` to manage your dependencies.

```bash
conda create -n myenv python=3.10
conda activate myenv
```

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
