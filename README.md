# motion

A framework for building ML applications, using a trigger-based execution model.

## Getting Started

You must use Python 3.7. We recommend using poetry to manage your virtual environment and dependencies. You can install poetry [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs/). Once you have poetry installed, clone this repo and run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```
